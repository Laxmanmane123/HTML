      Dogs are one of the most loyal animals. For ages, they have served as the
      pet animals of households. Their honesty and loyalty have no match. They
      are one of the most selfless creatures and just love to be around their
      owners. Pets are nothing less than a part of the family. They give
      unconditional love to their owners. In fact, these days, the term “owner”
      is fading. People consider their pets as their children and themselves as

      I am an animal lover. My pet animal is a dog. He is my favourite buddy. I
      have christened him Bandya. When he was only 12 days old, we brought him
      from a pet shop. In appearance, he is white in colour with brown bright
      eyes. It also has long fluffy hair on its body and a bushy tail which is
      loved by everyone in our home. I give him bread and milk every day. He is
      especially fond of meat and biscuits. Baba is a very faithful animal and
      protects our home. Whenever he sees an unknown person entering our house,
      he barks loudly at the strangers. He is a very charming and child-friendly
      animal. He is loyal and active as well. He sleeps early at night and wakes
      up late in the morning. When I come back from school, he jumps into my
      lap. In the evening, we go to the park for a walk and sometimes even play
      together with balls and flying discs. I am very happy with my dog, Baba.
      He has become an important member of our home. He is one of the loveliest
      pets I have ever seen in my whole life
