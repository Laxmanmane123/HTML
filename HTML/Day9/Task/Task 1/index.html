            I am Laxman Mane, a B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science
            and Engineering with a strong foundation in frontend (Flutter, HTML,
            CSS) and backend (Python, PHP, MySQL) development. I’ve gained
            hands-on experience through an internship at LeadSoft IT Solutions
            and have led impactful projects, including the Marketmate app. My
            leadership and problem-solving skills have been recognized through
            achievements like the Rising Star award at a major ideathon. I’m
            passionate about software design, development, and bringing fresh
            ideas to the tech industry.
